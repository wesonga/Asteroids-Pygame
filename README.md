# Asteroids-Pygame

A classic Asteroids game built using Pygame. This project replicates the mechanics of the iconic arcade game, featuring player movement, shooting, asteroid collisions, and splitting.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Rotate and move the spaceship using keyboard controls (WASD keys).
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Shoot projectiles to destroy asteroids.
- **Asteroid Collision**: Asteroids break into smaller pieces when hit by projectiles.
- **Game Over Logic**: The game ends when the player collides with an asteroid.
- **Visual Effects**: Asteroids and bullets are rendered dynamically using Pygame's drawing methods.

## Gameplay

- **Move the spaceship**: Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move and rotate the player spaceship.
- **Shoot bullets**: Press the spacebar to shoot a bullet at approaching asteroids.
- **Asteroids**: Asteroids split into smaller ones when hit by bullets and disappear when destroyed.
- **Game Over**: Colliding with an asteroid results in game over.
